    <h2>My top 3 movies</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Captain America</h3>
    <p>Not only is Chris Evans insanely sexy in this, the construction and especially character development is amazingly
        done for a superhero movie. Each part either develops the characters and their relationships or adds to the
        stakes of the general story.</p>
    <h3>Tangled</h3>
    <p>My favorite Disney movie by far. The main character is siply adorable and the love interest is a lot less
        one-dimensional than in any other Disney film. Plus there's some self-awareness in this movie that makes it even
        funnier. Some of the songs are a little weak, but there aren't too many and the rest of the
        movie is actually good, wether you're an adult or a child.</p>
    <h3>Stardust</h3>
    <p>This movie has adventure, romance, humor, fantasy, really bad villains and even a unicorn. What else could you
        ask for?</p>
